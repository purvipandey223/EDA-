# 📊 Employee Data Statistical Analysis

## 📁 Project Description

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **fundamental statistical methods** applied to a dataset containing employee information such as age, gender, department, education level, salary, and performance evaluation. The primary goal is to understand the distribution, central tendencies, variability, and probability characteristics of the data.

The project is organized into several analytical tasks that demonstrate key concepts in statistics and probability using real-world-like HR data.

## 📌 Tasks Performed

### 🧮 Task 1: Measure of Central Tendency
- Calculate **mean**, **median**, and **mode** for numerical variables like:
  - `age`
  - `basePay`
  - `bonus`
  - `perfEval`

### 📈 Task 2: Measure of Spread / Dispersion
- Compute:
  - **Range**
  - **Variance**
  - **Standard Deviation**
- Assess how dispersed salary and performance data are across departments and roles.

### 🔢 Task 3: Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- Apply PMF to discrete variables such as `perfEval` and `seniority`
- Visualize distributions (e.g., bar charts)

### 📉 Task 4: Probability Density Function (PDF)
- Analyze continuous variables like `basePay` and `bonus`
- Visualize distributions using kernel density estimates (KDE)
